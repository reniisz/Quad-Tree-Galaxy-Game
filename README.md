# 🌌 A Space Adventure with the Galactic Map

An interactive C++ game that challenges players to explore a galaxy filled with mysterious planets, black holes, and energy crystals. Powered by a custom **Quad-Tree** data structure, the game handles spatial data efficiently, ensuring fast search and insertion as the universe expands.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Custom Quad-Tree Implementation**  
  Built from scratch to manage 2D spatial data with efficient node insertion, search, and deletion.

- 🌠 **Exploration Gameplay**  
  Navigate a procedurally structured universe, guess galaxy energy levels, and collect crystals.

- 🧠 **Data Structure Mastery**  
  Reinforces concepts like object-oriented programming, recursive tree traversal, and memory management.

- 🎯 **Rebuild on Deletion**  
  When a galaxy is deleted, the tree is rebuilt by skipping deleted nodes—preserving clean structure.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++** – Core programming language used for the game and data structure logic  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – For clean, modular, and reusable code  
- **Custom Quad-Tree Structure** – Efficient handling of spatial data and searches  
- **File I/O** – Reading galaxy data from external files (`input1.in`, `output1.out`)  
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)** – Interactive exploration experience in the terminal  
- **Standard Template Library (STL)** – Utilized for basic functions like string handling and math
