# Quad-Tree-Galaxy-Game
ðŸŒŒ A Space Adventure with the Galactic Map
An interactive C++ game that challenges players to explore a galaxy filled with mysterious planets, black holes, and energy crystals. Powered by a custom Quad-Tree data structure, the game handles spatial data efficiently, ensuring fast search and insertion as the universe expands.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Custom Quad-Tree Implementation
Built from scratch to manage 2D spatial data with efficient node insertion, search, and deletion.

ðŸŒ  Exploration Gameplay
Navigate a procedurally structured universe, guess galaxy energy levels, and collect crystals.

ðŸ§  Data Structure Mastery
Reinforces concepts like object-oriented programming, recursive tree traversal, and memory management.

ðŸŽ¯ Rebuild on Deletion
When a galaxy is deleted, the tree is rebuilt by skipping deleted nodesâ€”preserving clean structure.
